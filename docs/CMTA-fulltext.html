<p>Where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of Section 701 of this Act, it is to be determined by proceeding sequentially through the succeeding sections hereof to the first such section under which the customs value can be determined.  Except as provided in Section 704 of this Act, it is only when the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of a particular section that the provisions of the next section in the sequence can be used.</p>
<p>If the importer does not request that the order of Sections 704 and 705 of this Act be reversed, the normal order of the sequence is to be followed. If the importer so requests but it is impossible to determine the customs value under Section 705 of this Act, the customs value shall be determined under Section 704.</p>
<p>When the customs value cannot be determined under Sections 701 through 705, it may be determined under Section 706 of this Act.</p>

<p>Persons who are associated in business with one another in that one is the sole agent, sole distributor or sole concessionaire, however described, of the other shall be deemed to be related for the purposes of this Act if they fall within, any of the eight (8) cases cited in the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>In a sale between related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted as basis for customs valuation whenever the importer demonstrates that such value closely approximates one of the following occurring at or about the same time:</p>
<p>(a) The transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical or similar goods for export to the same country of importation;</p>
<p>(b) The customs value of identical or similar goods as determined under the provisions of Section 704 of this Act; or</p>

For purposes of this section, &quot;Similar goods&quot; refer to goods which, although not alike in all respects, have like characteristics and similar component materials which enable them to perform the same functions and to be commercially interchangeable. The quality of the goods, its reputation and the existence of a trademark shall be among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar.</p>
<p>If, in applying this section, more than one transaction value of identical goods are found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs value.</p>
<p>SEC. 704. Deductive Value ‚Äì Method Four. ‚Äì Where the dutiable value cannot be determined under the preceding method, the dutiable value shall be the deductive value unless otherwise requested by the importer as provided in Section 700 hereof.

<p>(4) The customs duties and other national taxes payable in the Philippines by reason of the importation or sale of the goods.</p>
<p>If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued in the Philippines in the conditions they were imported, the customs value shall, subject to the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph, be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods sold in the Philippines in the condition they were imported and at the earliest date after the importation of the goods being valued, but before the expiration of ninety (90) days after such importation.</p>
<p>If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold in the Philippines in the condition as imported, then, if the importer so requests, the dutiable value shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, after further processing, are sold in the greatest aggregate quantity to persons in the Philippines who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, subject to allowance for the value added by such processing and deductions provided under subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) hereof.</p>
<p>SEC. 705. Computed Value ‚Äì Method Five. ‚Äì Where the dutiable value cannot be determined under the preceding method, the dutiable value shall be the computed value of the sum of:</p>
<p>(1) The cost or the value of materials and fabrication or other processing employed in producing the imported goods;</p>
<p>(2) The amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the Philippines;</p>

<p>SEC. 706.

<p>No dutiable value shall be determined under method six on the basis of:</p>
<p>(1) The selling price in the Philippines of goods produced in the Philippines;</p>
<p>(2) A system that provides for the acceptance for customs purposes of the higher of two (2) alternative values;</p>
<p>(3) The price of goods in the domestic market of the country of exportation;</p>

When a declaration has been presented and when the Bureau has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of such declaration, it may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 701 of this Act.</p>
<p>If in the course of determining the dutiable value of imported goods, it becomes necessary to delay the final determination of such dutiable value, the importer shall nevertheless be able to secure the release of the imported goods upon posting of a sufficient security in an amount equivalent to the duties and taxes in dispute conditioned on the payment of additional duties and taxes, if any, as may be determined: Provided, That prohibited goods shall not be released under any circumstance.</p>
<p>If, after receiving further information, or in the absence of a response, the Bureau still has reasonable doubts on the truth or accuracy of the declared value, it may deem that the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under method one, without prejudice to an importer&#x27;s right to appeal pursuant to Section 1104 of this Act. Before taking a final decision, the District Collector shall communicate to the importer, in writing if requested, the grounds for doubting the truth or accuracy o¬£ the particulars or documents produced and give the importer a reasonable opportunity to respond.

<li>
<p>(1) The titles of sections, chapters and subchapters are provided for easy reference only. For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2)(a) Any reference in a heading to the goods shall be taken to include a reference to the same in their incomplete or unfinished form or state: Provided, That the incomplete or unfinished goods have the essential character, as presented, of the complete or finished goods. It shall also be taken to include a reference to the same, in their complete or finished form or state (or falling- to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this Rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) When by application of Rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two (2) or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two (2) or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
